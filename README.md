  The Home Decor Store is a place where a user can sell home decor items. They have the ability to view their current inventory and each item within
  the inventory individually. Each item has it's name, description, color, dementions, and quantity. Using a many-to-many relationship an item also
  has a warehouse location atribute. A user can select from the warehoues that exist or they have the ability to add a new warehouse.
